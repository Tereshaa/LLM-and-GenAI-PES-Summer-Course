Form 10-K Summary 57This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private \\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Many of the forward-looking statements are \\nlocated in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Business” and Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading \\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Forward-looking statements \\nprovide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly \\nrelate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking \\nstatements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” \\n“plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of \\nfuture performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking \\nstatements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this \\nForm 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking \\nstatements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to \\nparticular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated \\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers \\ncollectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\\nPART I\\nItem 1. Business\\nCompany Background\\nThe Company designs , manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and \\nsells a variety of related services. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of \\nSeptember.\\nProducts\\niPhone\\niPhone® is the Company’s line of smartphones based on its iOS operating system. The iPhone line includes iPhone 14 Pro, \\niPhone 14, iPhone 13, iPhone SE®, iPhone 12 and iPhone 11.\\nMac\\nMac® is the Company’s line of personal computers based on its macOS® operating system. The Mac line includes laptops \\nMacBook Air® and MacBook Pro®, as well as desktops iMac®, Mac mini®, Mac Studio™ and Mac Pro®.\\niPad\\niPad® is the Company’s line of multipurpose tablets based on its iPadOS® operating system. The iPad line includes iPad Pro®, \\niPad Air®, iPad and iPad mini®.\\nWearables, Home and Accessories\\nWearables, Home and Accessories includes:\\n•AirPods®, the Company’s wireless headphones, including AirPods, AirPods Pro® and AirPods Max™;\\n•Apple TV®, the Company’s media streaming and gaming device based on its tvOS® operating system, including Apple \\nTV 4K and Apple TV HD;\\n•Apple Watch®, the Company’s line of smartwatches based on its watchOS® operating system, including Apple Watch \\nUltra ™, Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE®; and\\n•Beats® products, HomePod mini® and accessories.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 1Services\\nAdvertising\\nThe Company’s advertising services include various third-party licensing arrangements and the Company’s own advertising \\nplatforms.\\nAppleCare\\nThe Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare® brand. The offerings provide \\npriority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement \\nservices, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the \\ncountry and type of product.\\nCloud Services\\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and \\nWindows personal computers.\\nDigital Content\\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store®, that allow customers to discover and download applications \\nand digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade®, a game subscription \\nservice; Apple Fitness+SM, a personalized fitness service; Apple Music®, which offers users a curated listening experience with \\non-demand radio stations; Apple News+®, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+®, which offers exclusive \\noriginal content  and live sports.\\nPayment Services\\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card®, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay®, a cashless payment \\nservice.\\nMarkets and Distribution\\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government \\nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, \\nsmall and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its \\ndirect sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network \\ncarriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022 , the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution \\nchannels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\\nCompetition\\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price \\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of \\nthe Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating \\nthe Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal \\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 2The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \\nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \\nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \\nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \\nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \\nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \\nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \\nas competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \\nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s \\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \\nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \\nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of \\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, \\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual \\nproperty rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual \\nproperty rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, \\nthe Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \\ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \\nCompany has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single \\nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the \\nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include \\nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various \\naspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such \\nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future \\non reasonable terms or at all.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 3Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nHuman Capital\\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive \\nenvironment for all of its team members. As of September\\xa0 24, 2022 , the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time \\nequivalent employees.\\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of \\nharassment or discrimination.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the \\nCompany’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their \\nneeds and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide \\nvariety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ \\nindividual growth and development.\\nInclusion  and Diversity\\nThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the \\ncommunities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive \\nculture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\\nEngagement\\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps cr eate an \\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to \\ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee \\nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\\nHealth and Safety\\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace \\nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security \\nand crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard \\nenvironments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers \\nthrough its global security team. The Company has also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19 \\npandemic.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and \\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \\n“Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Such reports and other information \\nfiled by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-relations/sec-filings/default.aspx \\nwhen such reports are available on the SEC’s website. The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its \\ncorporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and \\nother information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance  matters, and details related \\nto the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-K is not \\nincorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual \\nreferences only.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 4Item 1A. Risk Factors\\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of \\nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize \\nfrom time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially \\nand adversely affected.\\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, \\npast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not \\nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking \\nstatements.\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \\nand Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial \\nStatements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and \\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial \\ncondition .\\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. \\nIn addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including \\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend \\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to \\ntrade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations \\ncan adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products \\nand services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial \\nmarket volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, \\nenergy shortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. \\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional \\neconomic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, \\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain \\ncredit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.\\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade \\nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue \\nnew debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic \\nfactors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock  price .\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and \\ncould in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to \\ntake unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, \\ntemporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times \\nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial ma rkets.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the \\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the \\ncourse of the pandemic, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have \\nexperienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the \\nfuture . Public safety measures can also adversely impact consumer demand for the Company’s products and services in \\naffected areas.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 5The Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and \\nrequirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and \\nfinancial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, \\nextent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and \\neffectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on \\nthe global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include \\nmaterial adverse effects on demand for the Company’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and \\ndistribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.\\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and \\nstock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, \\nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents \\nand other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material \\nadverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular \\nnetwork carriers and other channel partners.\\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, \\nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s \\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, \\nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, \\nsanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, \\nparticularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has \\nsignificant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being \\nimposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the \\nCompany’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs  can adversely \\nimpact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive \\nfor customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also \\nadopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the \\nCompany’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These \\nmeasures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, \\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or \\nchanged trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can \\nbe announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from \\nsuch measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly \\nmore severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade \\nand other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely \\naffect the Company’s business.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract \\nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and \\nfacilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial \\naccidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health \\nissues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate \\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can \\nmake it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and \\ninefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service \\nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant \\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the \\nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any \\nnegative consequences to the Company.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 6The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While \\nthe Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur \\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. \\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the \\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; \\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight \\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and \\ndistribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to \\ncover all losses that may arise.\\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological \\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price \\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the \\nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected \\nreturns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to \\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete \\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on \\nits\\xa0 intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the \\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if \\ncompetitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be \\nmaterially adversely affected.\\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces \\nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other \\nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the \\nCompany’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. \\nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain \\ncompetitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of \\nthe markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications \\nwithin their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also \\nexpects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their \\nofferings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and \\nexperience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models \\nthat provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content \\nand applications.\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to \\ncontinually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the \\nCompany will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 7Business Risks\\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions \\nand transitions of products and services.\\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company \\nmust continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively \\nstimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new \\nand upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, \\nincluding timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with \\nproduction ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of \\npurchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate \\nquantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or \\nother defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and \\ntransitions of products and services.\\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing \\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in \\nAsia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this \\nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions \\nto the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The \\nCompany has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower \\noperating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has \\nfrom time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services \\nprovided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these \\npartners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the \\nconsumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect \\nliabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the \\nsupplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results \\nof operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many \\ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s \\nhardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of \\ncomponents or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be \\ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial \\ndisputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade \\ndisputes.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, \\nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements \\nhelp ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial \\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of \\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on \\ncommercially reasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant \\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to \\nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s \\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high \\ndemand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to \\nobtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has \\nentered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or \\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can \\nlead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain \\nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic \\nconditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on \\nglobal and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s \\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition ,” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . \\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially \\nadversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 8The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product \\nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing \\ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any \\nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components \\ncustomized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has \\nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the \\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints \\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business \\nand financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient \\nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could \\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing \\ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues \\nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in \\ncomponents and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products \\nunsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s \\nproducts are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have \\nquality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from \\ntime to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the \\nCompany will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can \\nresult in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company \\ncan be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant \\nand equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory \\nfines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in \\nharm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and \\nservices, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase \\ncommitment cancellation risk.\\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated \\ndemand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for \\norders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its \\nsuppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be \\nrecoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which \\nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory \\nprepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company \\nwill not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence \\nin the industries in which the Company competes.\\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. \\nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for \\nperiods up to 150 days . Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price \\nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components \\nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on \\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires \\nlicenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently \\ncompetes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the \\nCompany’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to \\ntime, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. \\nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally \\nbe obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on \\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such \\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or \\notherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 9The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party \\nsoftware applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain \\nsoftware applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be \\ndeveloped and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.\\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the \\ndevelopers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services \\nfor the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for \\npersonal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on \\nfactors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected \\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers \\nless inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to \\ndeveloping and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on \\nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.\\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its \\nproducts. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party \\ndevelopers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these \\nchanges to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers.\\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, \\ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of \\napplications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to \\nits App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further \\nbusiness changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could require \\nfurther changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in \\nchanges to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how \\nand to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the \\nApp Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. \\nIf the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or \\neliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available \\non commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of \\noperations and financial condition.\\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or \\noffer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. \\nThe licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the \\ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers \\nand distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or \\nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may \\nseek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a \\nwide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for \\ntalent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused \\nadditional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. \\nIf requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be \\nno assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 10The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and \\navailability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and \\ninclusive culture.\\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued availability and \\nservice of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced \\npersonnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, \\nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are \\nconstantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely \\naffect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the C ompany is unable to \\nnurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who \\nare critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of \\noperations and financial condition.\\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and \\nresellers, many of which  distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services \\nand resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and \\neducation, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or \\nsubsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same \\namounts.\\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected \\nresellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can \\nrequire a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could \\nweaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the \\nCompany’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network \\ndisruptions.\\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused \\nby natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, \\nphysical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy \\nand other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and \\ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the \\nCompany’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer \\ntransactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely \\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject \\nthe Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the \\nCompany’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including \\nthrough the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot \\nprovide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially \\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company \\nrelies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. \\nAlthough the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on \\nthe Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential \\ninformation occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, \\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 11The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. \\nThese attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal \\nbusiness operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products \\nand services, impact the Company’s stock price , materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to \\nlitigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks \\nare expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques \\nthat are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the \\nCompany’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers \\ncan escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many \\ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and \\nthe value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent \\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of \\nencryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all \\neventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty \\npassword management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ \\nemployees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for \\nunauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the \\nCompany deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for \\nunusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or \\nloss of customer orders or impede  customer access to the Company’s products and services.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such \\ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not \\noriginally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and \\nfinancial condition.\\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may \\ninvolve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected \\nliabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, \\nregions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-\\noffs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory \\napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from \\ncompleting a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These \\nnew ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely \\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of \\nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\\nThe Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information \\nsystems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain \\nstores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique \\ndesign elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail \\nstores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor \\nperformance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and \\nseverance costs.\\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the \\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse \\neffect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store \\nconstruction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the \\nvalue of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 12Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable \\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary \\ncourse of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements \\nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and \\ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government \\ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, \\nhas generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and \\nnew claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents \\nand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual \\nproperty rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as \\ninternationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be \\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company \\nmay enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance \\nsuch agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly \\nincrease the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and \\nlimit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form \\n10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading \\n“Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a \\nmaterial loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other \\nclaims.\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against \\nthe Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s \\nresults of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an \\noutcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, \\nremedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business \\npractices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the \\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to \\ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to \\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; \\nprivacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services \\nand technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; internet , telecommunications, \\nand mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and \\nservices; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation \\nrestrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including \\nelectronic waste, recycling, and climate change.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 13Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely \\naffect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or \\nfeature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the \\nCompany’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such \\nlaws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and \\nservices are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented \\npolicies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the \\nCompany’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and \\nprocedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s \\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially \\nadversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able \\nto effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations \\nrelating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are \\ndesigned to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in \\npreventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be delayed or prohibited from \\nimportation, either of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and \\nfinancial condition.\\nExpectations  relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential \\nliabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. \\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on \\nenvironmental , social and governance  considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas \\nemissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its \\nenvironmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social and governance report, its other \\nnon-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these \\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involve s risks and \\nuncertainties, requi res investments , and depen ds in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s \\ncontrol. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and \\ninitiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived \\nfailure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives , adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or \\ninternational environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations \\nand standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the \\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory \\nscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.  \\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market \\nand legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU \\nDigital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could include how and to \\nwhat extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App \\nStore.\\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in \\nlegal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact \\non the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of \\ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse \\nfindings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its \\nApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial \\ncondition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s \\nbusiness practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become \\nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the \\nCompany’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, \\nresults of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other \\ncompanies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently \\nsubject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 14There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by \\nthe outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s \\nbusiness practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively \\nimpact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users \\nof the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor \\nmarket acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations \\nregarding data protection.\\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of \\nvarious types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict \\ntransfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws \\nin this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These \\nlaws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing \\nrequirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to \\nchange its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information \\nprovided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to \\ncomply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations \\ncould result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational \\nimpacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the \\nCompany is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health \\ndata, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach \\nnotification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance \\nwith these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial \\ndata is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, \\nthe Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, \\nand can also incur significant fees or fines.\\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder \\ninformation is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur \\nsignificant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also \\nexperience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow \\npayment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, \\nresults of operations and financial condition.\\nFinancial Risks\\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, \\nthe gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross \\nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global \\nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased \\ncompetition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product \\nlife cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, \\nacquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs \\neffectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that \\nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; \\ninflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or \\nservices with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of \\noperations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a \\ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to \\nunexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new \\nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the \\nCompany’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 15The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative \\nto local currencies.\\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated \\nsales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on \\nproducts that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency \\nexchange rate fluctuations.\\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign \\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing \\ndemand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to \\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross \\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign \\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its \\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may \\nincrease the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more \\nthan a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the \\nhedges are in place.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and \\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of \\nthe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, \\nalthough the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable \\nsecurities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the \\nCompany’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments \\nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, \\nretailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and \\neducation, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not \\ncovered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the \\nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to \\ncredit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks \\nmay be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by \\noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In \\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory \\ncomponents. As of September\\xa024, 2022 , the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term \\nsupply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has \\nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term \\nprepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to \\nadditional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the \\nCompany’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and \\nother non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates are \\naffected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax \\nassets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and \\nIreland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant jud gment and be subject to differing interpretations.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 16The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service \\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome \\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the \\noutcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the \\nultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s \\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe price of the Company’s stock  is subject to volatility.\\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, \\nthe Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price \\nand volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating \\nperformance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to \\nexceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future \\ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will \\ncontinue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are \\nsubject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it \\nto acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, \\ndividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which \\ncould have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 2. Properties\\nThe Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of  September\\xa024, 2022 , the Company owned or leased \\nfacilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in \\nvarious places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable \\nsegments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California \\nDistrict Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law \\nbased upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September \\n10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included \\nin Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California \\nDistrict Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition \\nlaw and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay \\npending the appeal.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \\nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth  quarter of 2022  that did not individually or in \\nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is \\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above \\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially \\nadversely affected.\\nItem 4.

Note 1, “Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policie s” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the \\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under \\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s \\nuncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and \\ninternational tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. \\nAlthough management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of \\nthese uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted \\nconsidering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a \\nmanner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and \\noperating results.\\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of \\nwhich are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount \\nis reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner \\ninconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating \\nresults.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 25Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone \\nbasis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the \\nCompany’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions \\nwill offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. \\nFurther, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses \\nrelated to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and \\noperating results.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding \\ndebt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. \\nChanges in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and \\nthe fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.\\nThe Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity \\nrequirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and \\nachieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of \\nminimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment \\ngrade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk \\nassociated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a \\nchange in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield \\ncurve. Based on investment positions as of September\\xa0 24, 2022  and September\\xa0 25, 2021 , a hypothetical 100 basis point \\nincrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market \\nvalue of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\\nAs of September\\xa024, 2022 , the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September\\xa025, 2021 , the Company had \\noutstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes  with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion  and $118.7 \\nbillion , respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk \\non its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate \\npayments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the \\ncorresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would \\ncause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September\\xa024, 2022  and September\\xa025, 2021  to increase by $201 million \\nand $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and \\nin particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in \\nU.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there \\nhas been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign \\nexchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future \\ncash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into \\nforeign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated \\ndebt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue \\nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign \\nexchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging \\nparticular exposures.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 26To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative \\npositions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of \\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random \\nmarket price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given \\nconfidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model \\nis not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm \\ncommitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of \\nthe model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of \\nSeptember\\xa024, 2022 , compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September\\xa025, 2021 . Because the \\nCompany uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are \\ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ \\nmaterially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\\xa0 24, 2022  due to the inherent limitations associated with \\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual \\nexposures and positions.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 27Item 8.

2022  Form 10-K | 33Apple Inc.\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote  1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” \\nor the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated . The preparation of these consolidated \\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires \\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from \\nthose estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been \\nreclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\\nThe Com pany’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is \\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters , which will  \\noccur in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 . The Company’s fiscal years 2022 , 2021  and \\n2020  spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the \\nCompany’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years .\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue \\nat the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is \\ngenerally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of \\nownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control \\ntransfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are \\ndelivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or \\ncommencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). \\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \\nestablished that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified up to three  performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, \\nMac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated \\nsales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to \\nreceive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the \\nright to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with \\neach device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative \\nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is \\nbased on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized \\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the \\nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis \\nover the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, \\nincluding estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled \\nservices and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 34For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party \\napplications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the \\nCompany does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such \\nsales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the \\ncollected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority .\\nShare-Based Compensation\\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on \\nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. \\nFurther information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans. ”\\nEarnings Per Share\\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022 , 2021  and 2020  (net income in \\nmillions and shares in thousands):\\n2022 2021 2020\\nNumerator:\\nNet income $ 99,803 $ 94,680 $ 57,411 \\nDenominator:\\nWeighted-average basic shares outstanding  16,215,963  16,701,272  17,352,119 \\nEffect of dilutive securities  109,856  163,647  176,095 \\nWeighted-average diluted shares  16,325,819  16,864,919  17,528,214 \\nBasic earnings per share $ 6.15 $ 5.67 $ 3.31 \\nDiluted earnings per share $ 6.11 $ 5.61 $ 3.28 \\nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities.\\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.\\nThe Company’s i nvestments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The \\nCompany classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying \\ncontractual maturity date.\\nThe Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their \\navailability for use in current operations.\\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method .\\nInventories\\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 35Restricted Marketable Securities\\nThe Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The \\nCompany reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance \\nSheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, \\nwhich for buildings is the shorter of 40 years  or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years  for machinery and \\nequipment, including manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. \\nCapitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the \\nassets, which range from five to seven years . Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant  and equipment was $8.7 \\nbillion , $9.5 billion  and $9.7 billion  during 2022 , 2021  and 2020 , respectively.\\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative \\ngains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred \\nin accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged \\ntransaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as \\ncash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a \\nstraight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. \\nChanges in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other \\ncomprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).\\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in \\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to \\nthe change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company \\nexcludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), \\nnet (“OI&E”) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges \\nare recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.\\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The \\nCompany classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash \\nFlows.\\nFair Value Measurements\\nThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in \\nactive markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments \\nand all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market \\nprices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings \\ncreated by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).\\nLeases\\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, \\ndata center and retail facilities. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of \\nthe Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 36Segment Reporting\\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the \\ninternal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s \\nreportable segments.\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the \\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe \\nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong \\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable \\nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is \\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market \\ndynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described  \\nelsewhere in this Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for \\ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in \\nthose geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and \\noperating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment \\nin which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain \\nexpenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate \\nexpenses such as research and development  (“R&D”),  corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation \\nexpenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The \\nCompany does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\\nNote 2  – Revenue\\nNet sales disaggregated  by significant products and services for 2022 , 2021  and 2020  were as follows (in millions):\\n2022 2021 2020\\niPhone (1)$ 205,489 $ 191,973 $ 137,781 \\nMac (1) 40,177  35,190  28,622 \\niPad (1) 29,292  31,862  23,724 \\nWearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 41,241  38,367  30,620 \\nServices (3) 78,129  68,425  53,768 \\nTotal net sales (4)$ 394,328 $ 365,817 $ 274,515 \\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in \\nthe sales price of the respective product.\\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod \\nmini and accessories.\\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other \\nservices.

A maximum of approximately 230 million  shares (split-adjusted) \\nwere authorized for issuance under the Purchase Plan at the time the plan was last amended and restated on March 10, 2015.\\n401(k) Plan\\nThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified deferred compensation arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue \\nCode. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their eligible earnings, subject to \\napplicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service and plan limits. The Company matches 50% to 100%  of each employee’s \\ncontributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.\\nRestricted Stock Units\\nA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2022 , 2021  and 2020 , is as follows:\\nNumber of\\nRSUs\\n(in thousands)Weighted-Average\\nGrant Date Fair\\nValue Per RSUAggregate\\nFair Value\\n(in millions)\\nBalance as of September 28, 2019  326,068 $ 42.30 \\nRSUs granted  156,800 $ 59.20 \\nRSUs vested  (157,743) $ 40.29 \\nRSUs canceled  (14,347) $ 48.07 \\nBalance as of September 26, 2020  310,778 $ 51.58 \\nRSUs granted  89,363 $ 116.33 \\nRSUs vested  (145,766) $ 50.71 \\nRSUs canceled  (13,948) $ 68.95 \\nBalance as of September 25, 2021  240,427 $ 75.16 \\nRSUs granted  91,674 $ 150.70 \\nRSUs vested  (115,861) $ 72.12 \\nRSUs canceled  (14,739) $ 99.77 \\nBalance as of September 24, 2022  201,501 $ 109.48 $ 30,312 \\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $18.2 billion , $19.0 billion  and $10.8 billion  for 2022 , 2021  and \\n2020 , respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2022 , 2021  and 2020  were net share settled such that the Company \\nwithheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and \\nremitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 41 million , 53 million  and 56 \\nmillion  for 2022 , 2021  and 2020 , respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as \\ndetermined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total  payments to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $6.4 \\nbillion , $6.8 billion  and $3.9 billion  in 2022 , 2021  and 2020 , respectively.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 47Share-Based Compensation\\nThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated \\nStatements of Operations for 2022 , 2021  and 2020  (in millions):\\n2022 2021 2020\\nShare-based compensation expense $ 9,038 $ 7,906 $ 6,829 \\nIncome tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ (4,002) $ (4,056) $ (2,476) \\nAs of September\\xa024, 2022 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $16.7 \\nbillion , which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years .\\nNote 10 – Commitments and Contingencies\\nConcentrations  in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \\nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services \\n(“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for \\nsupplier arrangements, internet services and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase \\nobligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September\\xa024, 2022 , are as follows (in millions):\\n2023 $ 13,488 \\n2024  4,876 \\n2025  1,418 \\n2026  6,780 \\n2027  312 \\nThereafter  412 \\nTotal $ 27,286 \\nContingencies\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that \\nhave not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at \\nleast a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, \\nconcerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 48Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2022 , 2021  and 2020  (in millions):\\n2022 2021 2020\\nAmericas:\\nNet sales $ 169,658 $ 153,306 $ 124,556 \\nOperating income $ 62,683 $ 53,382 $ 37,722 \\nEurope:\\nNet sales $ 95,118 $ 89,307 $ 68,640 \\nOperating income $ 35,233 $ 32,505 $ 22,170 \\nGreater China:\\nNet sales $ 74,200 $ 68,366 $ 40,308 \\nOperating income $ 31,153 $ 28,504 $ 15,261 \\nJapan:\\nNet sales $ 25,977 $ 28,482 $ 21,418 \\nOperating income $ 12,257 $ 12,798 $ 9,279 \\nRest of Asia Pacific:\\nNet sales $ 29,375 $ 26,356 $ 19,593 \\nOperating income $ 11,569 $ 9,817 $ 6,808 \\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2022 , 2021  and \\n2020  is as follows (in millions):\\n2022 2021 2020\\nSegment operating income $ 152,895 $ 137,006 $ 91,240 \\nResearch and development expense  (26,251)  (21,914)  (18,752) \\nOther corporate expenses, net  (7,207)  (6,143)  (6,200) \\nTotal operating income $ 119,437 $ 108,949 $ 66,288 \\nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2022 , 2021  and \\n2020 .

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \\nApple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are \\nrequired to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules \\nand regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included \\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\\xa0relates to accounts or disclosures that are \\nmaterial to the financial statements and (2)\\xa0 involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of \\ncertain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and \\nexperience with related taxing authorities.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and \\nprocedures that (1)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions \\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to \\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts \\nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \\ncompany; and (3)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nOctober\\xa027, 2022\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 52Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\\nNone.\\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal \\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined \\nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\\xa0 24, 2022  to provide reasonable \\nassurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is \\n(i)\\xa0 recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and \\n(ii)\\xa0 accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal \\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted \\naccounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \\nthat:\\xa0\\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the Company’s assets;\\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in \\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s \\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can \\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a \\ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative \\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute \\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of \\ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in \\nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting \\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the \\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework \\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s \\nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September\\xa024, 2022  \\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in \\naccordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit \\nreport on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022 , which were \\nidentified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the \\nExchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over \\nfinancial reporting.\\nApple Inc. | 2022  Form 10-K | 53Item 9B.

provided, however, that no such modification or amendment may, without the consent of the holder \\nof each outstanding Note of that series affected thereby:\\n•change the stated maturity of the principal of, or installment of interest on, any Note;\\n•reduce the principal amount of any Note or reduce the amount of the principal of any Note which would \\nbe due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof or reduce the rate of \\ninterest on any Note;\\n•reduce any premium payable on the redemption of any Note or change the date on which any Note may \\nor must be redeemed (in the case of the 2018 Indenture, it being understood that a change to any \\nnotice requirement with respect to such date shall not be deemed to be a change of such date);\\n•change the coin or currency in which the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note is \\npayable;\\n•impair the right of any holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the stated \\nmaturity of any Note (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);\\n•reduce the percentage in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, the consent of whose holders is \\nrequired in order to take certain actions;\\n•reduce the requirements for quorum or voting by holders of Notes in the applicable Indenture or the \\nNote;\\n11•modify any of the provisions in the applicable Indenture regarding the waiver of past defaults and the \\nwaiver of certain covenants by the holders of Notes except to increase any percentage vote required or \\nto provide that certain other provisions of the applicable Indenture cannot be modified or waived without \\nthe consent of the holder of each Notes affected thereby;\\n•make any change that adversely affects the right to convert or exchange any debt security or decreases \\nthe conversion or exchange rate or increases the conversion price of any convertible or exchangeable \\ndebt security, unless such decrease or increase is permitted by the terms of the debt securities; or\\n•modify any of the above provisions.\\nWe and the trustee may, without the consent of any holders, modify or amend the terms of the Indentures \\nand any series of Notes with respect to the following:\\n•to add to our covenants for the benefit of holders of all or any series of the Notes or to surrender any \\nright or power conferred upon us;\\n•to evidence the succession of another person to, and the assumption by the successor of our \\ncovenants, agreements and obligations under, the applicable Indenture pursuant to the covenant \\ndescribed above under the caption “Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”;\\n•to add any additional events of default for the benefit of holders of all or any series of the Notes;\\n•to add one or more guarantees, and in the case of the 2018 Indenture, co-obligors, for the benefit of \\nholders of the Notes;\\n•to secure the Notes pursuant to the covenants of the Indenture;\\n•to add or appoint a successor or separate trustee or other agent;\\n•to provide for the issuance of additional debt securities of any series;\\n•to establish the form or terms of the debt securities of any series as permitted by the Indenture;\\n•to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depository;\\n•to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;\\n•in the case of the 2013 Indenture, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the 2013 \\nIndenture in respect of one or more series of debt securities; provided that any such addition, change or \\nelimination (a) shall neither (1) apply to any debt security of any series created prior to the execution of \\nsuch supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (2) modify the rights of the \\nholder of any such debt security with respect to such provision or (b) shall become effective only when \\nthere is no debt security described in clause (a)(1) outstanding;\\n•in the case of the 2018 Indenture, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the 2018 \\nIndenture in respect of one or more series of debt securities; provided that any such addition, change or \\nelimination shall become effective only when there is no outstanding security of any series created prior \\nto the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provision and as to \\nwhich such supplemental indenture would apply;\\n•to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;\\n•to change any other provision; provided that the change does not adversely affect the interests of the \\nholders of debt securities of, in the case of the 2013 Indenture any series, and in the case of the 2018 \\nIndenture, any outstanding series, in any material respect;\\n•to supplement any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to \\npermit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Notes pursuant to the Indenture; \\n12provided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Notes of such \\nseries or any other series of debt securities in any material respect;\\n•to comply with the rules or regulations of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on \\nwhich any of the Notes may be listed or traded; and\\n•to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture as shall be necessary or \\ndesirable in accordance with any amendments to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and in \\nthe case of the 2013 Indenture, provided that such action does not adversely affect the rights or \\ninterests of any holder of debt securities in any material respect.\\nThe holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series may, \\non behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive compliance by us with certain restrictive provisions of the \\nIndentures. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of a series \\nmay, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive any past default and its consequences under the \\napplicable Indenture with respect to the Notes of that series, except a default (1) in the payment of principal or \\npremium, if any, or interest on Notes of that series or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision of the applicable \\nIndenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each Note of that series. Upon any \\nsuch waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been \\ncured, for every purpose of the Indenture; however, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or \\nevent of default or impair any rights consequent thereon.\\nDischarge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\\nWe may discharge certain obligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been \\ndelivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable or will become due and \\npayable within one year (or scheduled for redemption within one year) by depositing with the trustee, in trust, funds in \\nU.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including, but not limited to, the principal and \\npremium, if any, and interest to the date of such deposit (if due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the \\nredemption date of the Notes of that series, as the case may be. We may direct the trustee to invest such funds in \\nU.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term \\nU.S. Treasury securities.\\nThe Indentures provide that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all \\nobligations with respect to the Notes of a series (except for, among other things, obligations to register the transfer or \\nexchange of the Notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, to maintain an office or \\nagency with respect to the Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (“legal defeasance”) or (2) to be released \\nfrom our obligations to comply with the restrictive covenants under the applicable Indenture, and any omission to \\ncomply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the Notes of a series \\nand clauses (3) and (6) under the caption “Events of Default” above will no longer be applied (“covenant \\ndefeasance”). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other \\nthings, the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government \\nobligations (as such term is modified below), or both, applicable to the Notes of that series which through the \\nscheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient \\nto pay the principal or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor.\\nIf we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. \\ngovernment obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the \\nopinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at \\nthe time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of \\nthe acceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such \\namounts due at the time of acceleration.\\nWith respect to the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 \\nNotes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, the term “U.S. government obligations” shall \\ninstead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the German government or (ii) an obligation of a person \\ncontrolled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the German government the payment of \\nwhich is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the German government or the central bank of the German \\ngovernment, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) \\n13certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations \\ndescribed in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect thereof. \\nWith respect to the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, the term “U.S. government obligations” shall \\ninstead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the United Kingdom government or (ii) an obligation of a \\nperson controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United Kingdom government the \\npayment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the United Kingdom government or the central bank of \\nthe United Kingdom government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the \\nissuer thereof, and (y)\\xa0certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest \\nin obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect \\nthereof. \\nWe will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance \\nwill not cause the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes of that series to recognize income, gain or loss for \\nfederal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from \\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect.\\nWe may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant \\ndefeasance option.\\nBook-Entry and Settlement\\nThe Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with, or on behalf \\nof, a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, and are registered in the name of the common \\ndepositary or its nominee. Except as described herein, certificated notes will not be issued in exchange for beneficial \\ninterests in the global notes.\\nCertificated Notes\\nSubject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated \\nnotes in definitive form of like tenor, in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of \\n€1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 \\nNotes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, and in minimum denominations \\nof £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 3.050% 2029 Notes \\nand the 2042 Notes, if: \\n1.the common depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if the \\ncommon depositary ceases to be eligible under the applicable Indenture and we do not appoint a \\nsuccessor depository within 90 days;\\n2. we determine that the Notes will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver \\nto the trustee an order to that effect; or\\n3. an event of default with respect to the Notes will have occurred and be continuing. \\nAny Note that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes issuable in authorized \\ndenominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a \\nglobal note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the \\nname of the common depositary or its nominee. \\nThe Trustee for the Notes\\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee under the Indentures. We have \\ncommercial deposits and custodial arrangements with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and its \\naffiliates (“BNYM”). We may enter into similar or other banking relationships with BNYM in the future in the normal \\ncourse of business. In addition, BNYM acts as trustee and as paying agent with respect to other debt securities \\nissued by us, and may do so for future issuances of debt securities by us as well.\\n14Exhibit 21.1\\nSubsidiaries of\\nApple Inc.*\\nJurisdiction\\nof\\xa0Incorporation\\nApple Asia Limited Hong Kong\\nApple Asia LLC Delaware, U.S.\\nApple Canada Inc.

      "Competition\n",
      "The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price \n",
      "competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \n",
      "product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid\n",

      "The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \n",
      "new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \n",

      "significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \n",
      "with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \n",
      "and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \n",
      "prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products\n",
      "at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \n",
      "free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \n",
      "as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \n",

      "Supply of Components\n",
      "Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \n",
      "components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \n",
      "other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \n",
      "components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\n",

      "technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \n",
      "increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \n",
      "concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\n",

      "Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\n",
      "Research and Development\n",
      "Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s \n",
      "ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \n",

      "property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, \n",
      "the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\n",
      "The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \n",
      "development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \n",
      "Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single\n",
      "intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the \n",
      "duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\n",
      "In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include \n",
      "intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various \n",
      "aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such \n",

      "The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in\n",
      "part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \n",

      "distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \n",
